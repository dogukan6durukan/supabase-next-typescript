# Supabase Typescript NextJS

This project includes CRUD
operations where authenicated users
create, read, update and delete blogs that is provided
by supbase's authenication system which is RSL.
Besides used supabase CLI to genereate types of schema for
my blogs table in supabase and used it for type safe at my operations.  
Also worked with supabase database for storing blogs
and used Next JS's Client Side Navigation 
feature for navigate between 
blog posts without blocking user experience 
and pre render features provided by Next JS.
